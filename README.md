Web programming encompasses the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications using programming languages and technologies suited for the web environment. This includes client-side scripting languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and .NET. Additionally, frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js are commonly used for building modern web applications. Database technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite are often integrated to manage dynamic content and data storage. Understanding web protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS and web development tools like Git, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), and web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is also crucial in web programming.
